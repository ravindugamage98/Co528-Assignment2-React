# Co528-Assignment2-React

My previous Github accound was flagged by Github and it was recovered recently. I uploaded the files to the Github using the new account but I have cloned this to locally using the flagged account. That's why it is showing 2 accounts in the contribution area and both the accounts belong to me.
